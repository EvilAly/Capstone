# Capstone
Projects created/built on Team for ITP258 Capstone Course

These projects were created as part of the Capstone Course required for graduation. The first part of the course was working with a Raspberry Pi to install
the software for both a Pi Hole and Retro Pi. The included projects were 100% coded by my team and me for grade.

The Log In GUI project was coded under the assumption that we were hired to complete the project and work with the client to provide a finished product.
The application was to run on the Raspberry Pi, and would not use internet access in any way. 

The ReadyRecipe project is a team idea that was submitted for approval to our professor. We were given one week to get approval and start Sprint 1 for this 
project, and three additional weeks to complete the project.
